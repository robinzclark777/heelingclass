      <h1>About Robin</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Robin has recently finished her third OTCH on her six year old Golden Retriever, Flare.  Her oldest dog, Toby, has 
      been one of the nation's top ranked Goldens for the past several years and has competed in the National Obedience Championship numerous times.
      Toby placed 10th at the 2022 NOC and is an OTCH12.  Flare recently won High Combined at the Golden Retriever National Speciality in 
      Monroe, Michigan.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Four year old Golden Retriever Nick finished his Utility Dog title in December 2022 and is now campaigning for his OTCH.</p>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Both Toby and Flare have won many HIT and HC awards.  Nick just won his first HC in the first trial after completing his UD.  
      All three dogs are known for working with joy and style.

      <h1>Why Relationship Matters</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Competitive obedience is completely different from other dogs sports.  The skills that are required are not intrinsically
      enjoyable to most dogs.  Heeling is no longer a matter of just walking passively at your side.  It is now defined more as a dance, more like dressage.  It is 
      anything BUT natural.  And it certainly is not a behavior that dogs have a desire to perform.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Many of the other skills in obedience are just as unnatural and boring for your dog as heeling...fronts, finishes, position changes.  In the Novice class
      the only truly enjoyable skill is the recall and even that is ritualized with a front and finish. If this is the case, then why would any sane person spend a lifetime 
      in a quest to perfect these odd scenarios?</p>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Relationship is the only reason to do this work.  It takes thousands of hours to teach a dog to heel properly.  During those thousands of hours,
      all of your time and energy is spent trying to understand what motivates your dog, what your dog loves, how your dog moves, how your dog thinks.  After you have spent a lifetime
      trying to explain to each other how to move together with grace, poise and precision, what remains is a bond that is as sacred and precious.  This bond is worth more than
      all the money and prizes in the world.  This bond is paid for with tears, sweat, frustration, money, blood, and more time than you can imagine.  After you have paid that price,
      you will be rewarded with the greatest experience of your life...heeling with a dog who only wants to heel because they love that you do it together.</p>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey">You can't get to this point with tasty treats and expensive fuzzy toys.  You get to this point by spending time together learning how each other
      think.  Spending time together, building respect for each other, appreciating each other, fighting and making up, talking things out, these are the activities that combine to build
      a relationship.</p>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey">When you go into that sacred space called the obedience ring, you take nothing but your dog, yourself and your relationship.  The goal is for the dog to
      do the skills because they love to do it with you.  Part of that equation is motivating the dog (with food, toys, and play) to do the activity.  Another important part of
      the equation is teaching the dog that they must do what you say.  This is the part no one wants to do or to talk about because it is unpleasant.  All good relationships require
      difficult conversations, disagreements, arguments and reconciliations.  A relationship that is all unicorns and butterflies is fake and flimsy.  A relationship that is based upon
      years of honest dialogue is a priceless gift.</p>
