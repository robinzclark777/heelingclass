				<h1>Assignment 1</h1>

				<h5 class="w3-padding-32">The purpose of the pre-class homework
					is to get your dog into the right state of mind for training. In a
					nutshell, you need to get to a point where the dog has a strong
					desire for something that you have.</h5>

				<p class="w3-text-grey">The easiest way to learn how to do this
					is to watch dogs play....especially a puppy trying to engage an
					older dog. You have to become the playful puppy and make your
					presence relevant to your dog. In normal dog school classes this is
					achieved thru delicious food treats. This is easy to do with a
					hungry, food motivated dog. Unfortunately it only lasts as long as
					you have food. I am not fond of spending my valuable time on
					training methods that don't hold up in the utility ring, so if you
					are looking for a class that teaches you how to train your dog with
					just food, let me know and I can find a trainer that teaches food
					training.</p>

				<p class="w3-text-grey">Instead of using food in our training
					routine, we will be using hands on play. We will blend in some food
					and some toys but the emphasis will be on physical play. Do two
					dogs use food and toys when they play with each other? Nope.</p>

				<p class="w3-text-grey">For the next couple of months your
					homework will be to put your hands on your dog and play with them.
					You will not be training any behaviors. Your goal is to learn how
					to have fun together without using food and toys.</p>


				<p class="w3-text-grey">
					<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE!!!! Do not do this assignment with
						dogs that were bred for protection: German Shepherds, Dobermans,
						Malinois, Pit Pulls. I do not know how to train dogs that were
						bred for protection work and you could get badly injured. Only do
						this kind of work with dogs that have NO history of biting and
						aggression. My only expertise is in training dogs like Golden
						Retrievers and Border Collies. If you have protection oriented
						dogs I can help you find an appropriate trainer but it is not me!</strong>
				</p>

				<p class="w3-text-grey">For this first assignment, make sure
					that your dog is quite hungry and well rested. If your dog is
					overweight, delay this first assignment until they have lost some
					weight. Consult your vet on how to lose weight. I recommend eating
					less and going on lots of walks but I am not a medical
					professional. Depending upon how active your dog is they might need
					to relax in a crate for 4 to 8 hours before you do this work. IOW,
					make sure your dog is at the correct weight, has not eaten for at
					least 8 hours and has been resting in a crate for at least 4 hours.</p>

				<p class="w3-text-grey">Take your dog outside and let them
					potty, then come back inside your house. Make sure all other dogs
					are crated and you are in a quiet room with no distractions.</p>

				<p class="w3-text-grey">Have a bowl of food close at hand. Sit
					on the floor with your dog and start to pet them roughly. Grab
					their collar and smile. Give them a piece of food about every 20
					seconds. Crawl around the floor and roll around with them. Grab
					them all over their bodies. Touch their ears, their feet, their
					neck in a playful manner as you crawl all over the place. Just have
					fun! Be a puppy with them. This is a huge bonding experience. Let
					them chase your hands and feet. Push them around with your feet.</p>

				<p class="w3-text-grey">If your dog gets too excited, tone it
					down a bit and be less rough. If your dog bites you, say no and tap
					their nose. As soon as they calm down start to play again but at a
					lower level of arousal.</p>

				<p class="w3-text-grey">You can use a toy if you want to instead
					of the food or you can experiment with both. The goal is to get you
					both more comfortable with interacting physically. The goal is to
					teach your dog to play nicely and not get too rough with you.</p>

				<p class="w3-text-grey">If your dog is reluctant to play, then
					they might need to be hungrier or better rested. Some dogs just
					aren’t interested in this type of play or it might takes months of
					work to get them to enjoy it. If your dog is too rough and you
					can’t figure out how to stop them from biting you, do not continue!
					STOP!</p>

				<p class="w3-text-grey">Send me an email and let me know the
					details of how this assignment goes. If you can take a video, post
					it on youtube and send me a link that would be better!</p>
