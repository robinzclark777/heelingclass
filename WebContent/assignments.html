      <h1>About the Assignments</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The purpose of the assignments is increase the bond between you and your dog.  This takes time.  You want to begin the work in a non-distracting
      environment.  Slowly, over the next weeks, you will start to practice in different and more exciting environments while continuing to be the most important entity in your dog's universe.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">In order to accomplish this, we will pair hands-on play with very desirable rewards.  These rewards can be food and/or toys.  In order to make them
      extra desirable, you will plan your days so that your dog is well rested, bored, and hungry before you do your homework.</p>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Along with your homework assignments where you practice hands-on play, we will introduce some simple rules to your household routines.  These rules will
      teach your dogs to pay close attention to the directions that you are giving them.  The rules will be completely disconnected from any kind of competitive obedience behavior or tricks.  In addition
      to teaching your dog that your words are important, the introduction of these rules will improve your dog's household manners, making them more pleasant to live with on a daily basis.  Perhaps 
      most importantly, the enforcement of these rules will help you to become more confident about using physical "corrections".  Most people are afraid to correct their dog because it causes the dog
      to "shut down".  From a scientific viewpoint this is entirely accurate...positive punishment causes a behavior to stop.  If you use positive punishment to try to get a dog to DO a behavior
      it will not work.  However, sometimes it is very useful to stop a behavior.  You just need to be clear on what you are trying to achieve.  If you want the dog to DO something, use positive reinforcement,
      i.e. rewards.  If you want a dog to stop doing something, use positive punishment.
      </p>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey">When people think about punishment or corrections, they most frequently think that means leash or collar corrections.  We will not be doing leash or collar corrections in this
      class.  Think about a momma dog who is trying to get a puppy to stop biting.  She doesn't use a leash or collar correction.  Instead, she uses her mouth to nip at the puppy or she uses her paw to swat
      the puppy.  Momma knows exactly how much force to use to stop the puppy from biting.  You must have the same amount of wisdom and love to correctly gauge the correct amount of force to use to stop a behavior.
      After the momma dog corrects her puppy, she might ignore the puppy for awhile or she might nuzzle the puppy if he needs reassurance.  You must be able to follow your correction with the right actions
      to convey the message.  Teaching you how to perform the right level of correction at the right time will be the primary goal of this class.
      </p>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey">If your personal philosophy prohibits you from using positive punishment in your training, please do not take this class.  Drop out before it starts so that someone else can
      have your spot.  Purely positive training is a philosophy that many trainers embrace and you won't have any troubles finding good classes that will help you.  When you first start to use corrections 
      in your training, your dog will look "not as happy" for a period of time before they grow more courageous.  If you are not willing to work thru these rough spots, now is the time to bail out.
      </p>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The goal of the pre-class homework is to hopefully work thru the majority of the rough spots that students encounter when they first begin to use corrections.  The worse thing
      that you can do is to NOT use corrections in your household manners and to use corrections in your obedience training.  Ideally you will use corrections AT HOME to deal with household manners and you will
      be able to do your obedience training with ZERO corrections.  Read this paragraph ten times to make sure that you understand it.  Corrections should be used AT HOME to deal with household manners. 
      In the obedience training that you do in public you should be able to use praise, play and gentle verbal markers exclusively.
